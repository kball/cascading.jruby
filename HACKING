Some hacking info on cascading.jruby

 * cascading.jruby can be packaged as a gem. To do so, you must generate the necessary packaging files:

	jruby -S rake gem

will produce the gem in the pkg/ dub-directory.
After that, just cd this directory and:

	jruby -S rake install cascading.jruby-xxx.gem
	
 * The "Cascading::Operations" module is mixed-in the Cascading::Assembly class to provide some shortcuts
 for common operations. I don't know if this is the best way to do it, though... 

 * The high level commands for creating new pipes are defined in cascading/helpers.rb.

 * The fil cascading/cascading.rb defines global helper methods for cascading like tap creation, fields
creation, etc.
